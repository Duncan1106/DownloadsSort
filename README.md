## File Sorter
A simple tool for sorting files in a folder by file extension.

## Prerequisites
    PowerShell

## Getting Started
    Download and extract the repository.
    Open the File Sorter.ps1 script in PowerShell.
    A form will appear with a list of file extensions and two buttons: "Select Folder" and "Sort Files".
    Select a file extension from the list.
    Click the "Select Folder" button and choose the target folder where you want to move the files with the selected file extension.
    Click the "Sort Files" button to move the files with the selected file extension to the target folder.

## Notes
    The script searches for files in the Downloads folder.
    If a file with the same name already exists in the target folder, it will be skipped.
    If no file extension is selected or no target folder is specified, the script will output a message and skip the sorting process.
